### Project description

A game for my sister. 
A lego car she made was recreated as a 3d model and you can drive it in this game.

In this project I did programming and sound effects.\
[tenori-nori](https://github.com/tenori-nori) did 3d modeling, music and level design.

You can play a web version of the game [here](https://toxazol.itch.io/game-for-sonya).

The game features path-finding car NPCs affected by traffic lights and a mini-map.
